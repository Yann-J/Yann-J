# Hi, I’m @Yann-J 👋

I'm a Tech enthusiast for work and leisure, currently director of Engineering @[One Acre Fund 🌱](https://oneacrefund.org/) based in Kigali, Rwanda.

I love:

- 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 my wife and 2 kids!
- 👨‍💻 coding
- 📷 photography
- 🗺 traveling
- ...and basically learning anything (currently 🇪🇸 Spanish and blindfolded Rubik's cube!).
